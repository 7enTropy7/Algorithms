# Algorithms
My Codes for various Algorithms I learn...<br>
This repository is a collection of all codes based on pure Data Structures and Algorithm that I still have and felt like doing.<br>
This repository will contain codes with the same pseudocode in the 3 programming languages that I am comfortable coding in:<br>
* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.org/)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Credits
All of the codes in this repository have been learnt (but the codes are not copied) from this course:
